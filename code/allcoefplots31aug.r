# Coefficient plots and tables, 31 Aug
# Results of new analysis

# List of coefficient plots/tables to generate:

# 1. density scaling by diameter, with and without cutoff. AICs for each, as well as confidence intervals (allyears, 90light, and 95light)
# 2. density scaling by light, with and without cutoff (AICs, CIs) (90, 95)
# 3. individual production by diameter, with and without light received used as a covariate; AIC and CI for each (90, 95)
# 4. individual production by light received (90 and 95)
# 5. individual light received by diameter
# 6. binned production by diameter (all years, 90, and 95)
# 7. binned light received by diameter (90 and 95)
