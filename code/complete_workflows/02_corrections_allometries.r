# Script 2: Correct growth increments, remove outliers, join light data, and apply allometries.

# modified 11 November 2019: replace overall allometries with species-specific allometries
# modified 30 October 2019: move binning to another script.
# modified 22 October 2019 to correctly add new recruits to production -- also make the code a lot tidier.
# modified 25 June 2018 to use Nadja's newest FG classification

# Each bin dataframe should include the following
# 1 all individuals
# 2 all individuals classified in a FG
# 3-7 FGs 1 through 5
# 8 individuals not classified in a FG
