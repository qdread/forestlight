Histogram binning is basically an exercise in choosing the bin width so that the bins of the histogram resemble, as closely as possible, the theoretical density function. This is especially obvious for normal data. For example, here are some ways of making a histogram for 100 draws from a normal with mean 0 and standard deviation 1.

```{r}
xdata <- rnorm(100)

library(ggplot2)

p <- ggplot(data.frame(x=c(-4, 4)), aes(x=x)) + scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0), limits = c(0, 0.42)) + theme_bw() + theme(panel.grid = element_blank())
fx <- stat_function(geom='line', fun='dnorm', n=1001, args=list(mean=0,sd=1), size = 2, color = 'red')

h1 <- geom_histogram(data = data.frame(x = xdata), aes(x=x), stat = 'density', binwidth=1)

```
